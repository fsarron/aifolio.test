During my PhD, I have been an teaching assistant for 3 years (2015-2018) in physics in 1st and 2nd year of physics. I have taught TD, TP and colles in classical meachnics, hydrodynimcs and thermodynamics for a total of 192h.

In my CNES fellowship postdoc, I mentored several advanced students. I supervised internships of Master students (Edgar Vidal, Amine Abouzerzour). More informally, I also co-mentored (then) PhD student Aline Chu on a given project that lead to a publication.

In the upcoming academic year 2024-2025, I will teach praticals on stochastic optimization (12h).
