I work in collaboration with Pierre Weiss in the Mambo team in Toulouse, 
as part of the MicroBlind ANR project (https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-21-CE48-0008). 

I use deep learning for blind deblurring of fluorescence microscopy images. 
We are also working on instance segmentation of individuals cells in biological 
sample with partial annotations using neural networks.
