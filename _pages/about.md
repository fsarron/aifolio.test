I work in collaboration with Pierre Weiss in the Mambo team in Toulouse,
as part of the MicroBlind ANR project (https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-21-CE48-0008).

I use deep learning for blind deblurring of fluorescence microscopy images.
We are also working on instance segmentation of individuals cells in biological
sample with partial annotations using neural networks.

Over the course of my career in Astrophysics (PhD 2018), while studying galaxy
evolution using large photometric surveys, I have developped a strong interest
in inverse problem solving via a Bayesian approach. This led me to take the
position in the Mambo team to further explore inverse problem solving in high
dimensions in a different context.

I am still partially doing research in Astrophysics. I mainly study the
evolution of star-formation in galaxies through cosmic time. I am interested in
understanding the role played by the environment surrounding galaxies on large
scale on their history and their fate. I am still actively invested in several
international collaborations (Euclid, XCLASS).
