This led me to take the position in the Mambo team to further explore inverse problem solving in high dimensions in a different context.</p> <hr> <p>I still work part-time on my research in Astrophysics. There, I mainly study the evolution of star-formation in galaxies through cosmic time. I am interested in understanding the role played by the environment surrounding galaxies on large scale on their history and their fate. I am still actively invested in several international collaborations (Euclid, XCLASS).</p> </body></html>
