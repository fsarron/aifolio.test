This led me to take the position in the Mambo team to further explore inverse problem solving in high dimensions in a different context.</p> <hr> <p>I am still partially doing research in Astrophysics. I mainly study the evolution of star-formation in galaxies through cosmic time. I am interested in understanding the role played by the environment surrounding galaxies on large scale on their history and their fate. I am still actively invested in several international collaborations (Euclid, XCLASS)</p> <p>I have also developped several open-source pyhton programs over the years for my own research, or inside collaborations.
