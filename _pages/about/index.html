I am interested in using deep learning for blind deblurring of fluorescence microscopy images. We are also working on instance segmentation of individuals cells in biological sample with partial annotations using neural networks.</p> <p>Over the course of my career in Astrophysics (PhD 2018), while studying galaxy evolution using large photometric surveys, I have developped a strong interest in inverse problem solving via a Bayesian approach. This led me to take the position in the Mambo team to further explore inverse problem solving in high dimensions in a different context.</p> <p>I am still partially doing research in Astrophysics. I mainly study the evolution of star-formation in galaxies through cosmic time. I am interested in understanding the role played by the environment surrounding galaxies on large scale on their history and their fate. I am still actively invested in several international collaborations (Euclid, XCLASS)</p> <p>I have also developped several open-source pyhton programs over the years for my own research, or inside collaborations.
