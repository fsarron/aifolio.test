I work with <a href="https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~weiss/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Pierre Weiss</a> as part of the <a href="https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-21-CE48-0008" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">MicroBlind ANR project</a>.</p> <p>I study <strong>inverse problems in optical microscopy</strong>, currently carrying two main projects:</p> <ol> <li> <strong>Deep learning for blind deblurring</strong> of fluorescence microscopy images.</li> <li> <strong>Neural networks for instance segmentation</strong> of individuals cells in images biological sample with <em>partial annotations</em>.</li> </ol> <p>Over the course of my career in Astrophysics (PhD 2018), I have developped a strong interest in <strong>inverse problem solving <em>via</em> a Bayesian approach</strong> while studying galaxy evolution using large photometric surveys.<br> This led me to take a position in the MAMBO team to further explore inverse problem solving in high dimensions in a different context.</p> <hr> <p><strong>I still work part-time on my research in Astrophysics</strong>. There, I mainly study the evolution of star-formation in galaxies through cosmic time. I am interested in understanding the role played by the environment surrounding galaxies on large scales on their history and their fate. I am still actively invested in several international collaborations (Euclid, XCLASS).</p> <hr> </body></html>
